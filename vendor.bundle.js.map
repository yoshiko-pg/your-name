The context for\n  * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n  * to the current item from the iterable.\n  * *\n  * ### Local Variables\n  * *\n  * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n  * *\n  * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n  * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n  * iteration.\n  * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n  * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n  * *\n  * ### Change Propagation\n  * *\n  * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n  * *\n  * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n  * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n  * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n  * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n  * *\n  * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n  * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n  * controls\n  * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n  * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n  * as user input.\n  * *\n  * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n  * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n  * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n  * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n  * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n  * be avoided if possible.\n  * *\n  * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n  * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n  * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n  * *\n  * ### Syntax\n  * *\n  * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n  * *\n  * With `<template>` element:\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n  * <li>...</li>\n  * </template>\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n  * example.\n  * *\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

If used\n  * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n  * control.\n  * *\n  * *\n  * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n  * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n  * *\n  * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n  * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n  * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n  * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n  * the domain model in your class as well.\n  * *\n  * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n  * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n  * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n  * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n  * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n  * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n  * *\n  * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n  * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n  * *\n  * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n  * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n  * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n  * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n  * *\n  * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n  * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n  * than the domain model's value on submit.\n  * *\n  * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n  * *\n  * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n  * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n  * *\n  * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n  * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n  * *\n  * @stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

Like in the former example, you have the\n  * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n  * *\n  * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n  * *\n  * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n  * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n  * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n  * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n */\nexport var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(this._getOptionId(value), value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (looseIdentical(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n  * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n  * *\n  * ### Example\n  * *\n  * ```\n  * const form = new FormGroup({\n  * password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n  * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n  * *\n  * *\n  * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n  * return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n  * ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n  * }\n  * ```\n  * *\n  * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n  * *\n */\nexport var FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} controls\n     * @param {?=} validator\n     * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n     */\n    function FormGroup(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     *  Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n      * *\n      * This method does not update value or validity of the control, so for\n      * most cases you'll want to use {@link FormGroup.addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     *  Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n      * *\n      * It will return false for disabled controls.

It can be used in the following ways:\n * - Specify the svgSrc input to load an SVG icon from a URL.

If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n *\n * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nexport var MdIcon = (function () {\n    function MdIcon(_elementRef, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        /** Screenreader label for the icon. */\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(MdIcon.prototype, \"color\", {\n        /** Color of the icon. */\n        get: function () { return this._color; },\n        set: function (value) { this._updateColor(value); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    MdIcon.prototype._updateColor = function (newColor) {\n        this._setElementColor(this._color, false);\n        this._setElementColor(newColor, true);\n        this._color = newColor;\n    };\n    MdIcon.prototype._setElementColor = function (color, isAdd) {\n        if (color != null && color != '') {\n            this._renderer.setElementClass(this._elementRef.nativeElement, \"md-\" + color, isAdd);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

Since all interactions between {@link\n  * Router} /\n  * {@link Location} / {@link LocationStrategy} and DOM apis flow through the `PlatformLocation`\n  * class\n  * they are all platform independent.\n  * *\n * @abstract\n */\nexport var PlatformLocation = (function () {\n    function PlatformLocation() {\n    }\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    PlatformLocation.prototype.getBaseHrefFromDOM = function () { };\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    PlatformLocation.prototype.onPopState = function (fn) { };\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    PlatformLocation.prototype.onHashChange = function (fn) { };\n    Object.defineProperty(PlatformLocation.prototype, \"pathname\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return null; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(PlatformLocation.prototype, \"search\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return null; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(PlatformLocation.prototype, \"hash\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return null; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @param {?} state\n     * @param {?} title\n     * @param {?} url\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    PlatformLocation.prototype.replaceState = function (state, title, url) { };\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @param {?} state\n     * @param {?} title\n     * @param {?} url\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    PlatformLocation.prototype.pushState = function (state, title, url) { };\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    PlatformLocation.prototype.forward = function () { };\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    PlatformLocation.prototype.back = function () { };\n    return PlatformLocation;\n}());\n//# sourceMappingURL=platform_location.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/@angular/common/src/location/platform_location.js\n// module id = 186\n// module chunks = 2","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.
